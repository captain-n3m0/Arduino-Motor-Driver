# ARDUINO-MOTOR-DRIVER
# NOTE
This code assumes that you are using a simple radio transmitter and receiver to send the motor speed signals to the Arduino. If you are using a different type of transmitter or receiver, you will need to modify the code to read the signals correctly. Additionally, if you are using a different type of motor driver (such as a stepper motor driver), you will need to modify the code accordingly.
